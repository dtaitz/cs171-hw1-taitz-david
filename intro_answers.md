<li>If we were interested in understanding summary statistics at a glance (minimum, maximum, etc.), how could you improve the display of the table?

If the aim was to make summary statistics more accessible, giving the user the ability to sort the columns would help improve the display of the table. Another way a table could do this is to color code the table so that the max and the min are at different ends of the spectrum. Alternatively, one could play with font so that the max would have the biggest font and the min would have the smallest font.</li>


<li>Find three varied examples on the web that present tabular data in a different layout or in more visually compelling, complete, interactive or interesting ways</li>

Even though this is still a table, this Tableau table is interesting because there are many dynamic elements that help you filter content of the table. By choosing certain presidents, you can be presidential spending over time, comparative presidential spending, and see what might have been cut back given a lower budget.

I enjoyed this visualization of tabular data of population density in the USA because it was a great use of the third dimension. Spikes on the maps visually resemble tall buildings which is the trademark of cities with large populations. As a result, the association of big building, cities and high population is particularly compelling.

While this is a collection of visualizations, this tour of Bloomberg's mayorship gave a personal touch to the dramatic differences in the New York City over the last 12 years. The New York Times combines color minalism, real life photography and data graphs to show change in landscape of New York beyond simple numbers of how many new buildings were constructed.
